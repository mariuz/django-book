====================
Stuff to cover later
====================

This is a running list of stuff that hasn't yet been mentioned in the
completed chapters of the book:

Using other template systems with Django
========================================
    
The serialization framework and the bundled simplejson.
=======================================================

As I write this, I think it might be a good idea if we have time to cave to
pressure and write a chapter on doing "AJAX" with Django.

Invalidating Django cache
=========================
Simon: [Chapter 14] is missing any discussion of the importance of
invalidating your cache manually to keep the site completely up to date - for
example, having code which clears the cache for the front page every time a
new blog entry is saved (rather than making you wait 5 minutes before it gets
displayed).

Jeremy: Perhaps this sort of thing is best handled with signals?

Book conventions
===========
[foo_name] is a placeholder for a user-given value.
decorator syntax 2.3 or 2.4?

Why aren't 3rd party libs bundled?
==================================
python-memcached isn't bundled, probly due to licensing complications. (It's
python licensed, while Django is BSD.) A policy statement would be good.
